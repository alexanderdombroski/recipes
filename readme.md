# Overview

I've made good progress learning JavaScript and I created this project to take some time and see how it compares. 

This program grabs data from a recipe API and fills it in the page. This was a great oppourtuinity to learn more about asyncrounous functions and try/except.

I'm using a free API that only allows 1000 requests per month and 10 per minute. If the images aren't pulling up, that's probably why.
